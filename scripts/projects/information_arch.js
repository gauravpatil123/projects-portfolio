The donations task was most unsuccessful with 9 of 11 participants failing to navigate to the page. Moreover, participants were confused and went back and forth through a lot of pages before selecting their option, this behavior suggested creating an independent category for donations.<br>3. Participants failed to locate at-home “Activities for Kids” page, participants also failed to distinguish between the at-home & on-site offering on the “Collections” page. This suggested that we should create a clear distinction between the at-home and on-site offerings.<br>4. No participants were able to find the museum financials suggesting that we create an independent category for it as well.<br>5. Although participants were able to navigate to the “Accessibility” category, they were not able to choose the correct subcategory, it was clear that too much specificity in this category was creating confusion.<br>These key insights led us to make some revisions in the information architecture.";
